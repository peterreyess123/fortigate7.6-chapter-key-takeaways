# Chapter 13: Security Fabric

## 1. Chapter Summary

This chapter explores the Fortinet Security Fabric, a foundational architecture for achieving comprehensive and integrated network security. It defines the Security Fabric as a holistic, enterprise-level solution that provides broad visibility, integrated defense, and automated response across the entire digital attack surface. The Fabric's core attributes—broad, integrated, and automated—are explained as the key pillars that allow organizations to manage risk effectively, reduce complexity from multiple point products, and respond to threats in real-time. The chapter outlines the various Fortinet products that can participate in the Fabric, from core components like FortiGate and FortiAnalyzer to extended solutions like FortiNAC, FortiWeb, and FortiClient EMS, all available in different consumption models such as physical appliance, virtual machine, or cloud service.

The chapter then details the structure and implementation of the Security Fabric. It establishes the roles of a **root FortiGate**, which acts as the central point of visibility and control, and **downstream devices** (like ISFW FortiGates, FortiSwitches, and FortiAPs) that connect to it. The process of building the Fabric involves configuring logging, enabling the Fabric on the root device and relevant interfaces, and authorizing downstream devices. A key operational aspect covered is the synchronization of objects, such as firewall addresses and services, from the root FortiGate to downstream members, including how to handle and resolve synchronization conflicts. The chapter also explains how multi-VDOM environments are represented within the Fabric, with each VDOM appearing as a distinct entity in the topology view.

Finally, the chapter covers the advanced features and monitoring tools that the Security Fabric provides. It introduces **Automation Stitches**, which create cause-and-effect workflows (trigger > action) to automate responses to security events, such as quarantining a compromised endpoint detected by FortiAnalyzer. The **Security Rating** feature is presented as a powerful tool for auditing the Fabric's configuration against security best practices, providing a numerical score and actionable recommendations to improve security posture. The chapter concludes by showcasing the various visualization tools, including the **Physical and Logical Topology** views, which provide a graphical, interactive map of all connected Fabric devices, their status, and the interfaces connecting them. These tools offer administrators unprecedented visibility and streamlined management of their entire security infrastructure from a single pane of glass.

### **Module 2: Deploying the Security Fabric**

**General Steps to Configure the Security Fabric:**
*   **Step 1 (On Root FortiGate):**
    *   Configure logging to a central FortiAnalyzer or FortiGate Cloud.
    *   Navigate to `Security Fabric > Fabric Connectors`.
    *   Enable the "FortiGate" connector and set the "Role" to **Fabric root**.
    *   Enable "Security Fabric connection" on the internal-facing interfaces where downstream devices will connect.
*   **Step 2 (On Downstream FortiGate):**
    *   Navigate to `Security Fabric > Fabric Connectors`.
    *   Create a new connector, select "FortiGate", and provide the IP address of the **upstream (root) FortiGate**.
    *   Enable "Security Fabric connection" on the upstream-facing interface.
*   **Step 3 (On Root FortiGate):**
    *   A notification will appear for the new downstream device.
    *   Navigate to the `Security Fabric > Fabric Connectors` page and **Authorize** the downstream FortiGate to officially join the Fabric.

**Synchronizing Objects Across the Security Fabric:**
*   Allows configuration objects like addresses, services, and schedules to be synced from the root to all downstream devices.
*   **`fabric-object-unification` (Root FortiGate CLI):**
    *   `default`: Global objects are synchronized to downstream devices.
    *   `local`: Global objects are not synchronized.
*   **`configuration-sync` (Downstream FortiGate CLI):**
    *   `default`: Synchronizes objects from the root.
    *   `local`: Does not participate in object synchronization but will pass on synced objects to devices further downstream.
*   **`set fabric-object {enable | disable}` (Per-object CLI):** Allows enabling or disabling synchronization for individual objects on the root FortiGate.
*   **Conflict Resolution:** If an object conflict occurs (e.g., same name, different content), a notification appears on the root GUI, allowing an administrator to resolve it by renaming or choosing which version to keep (Automatic or Manual).

**Multi-VDOM in the Security Fabric:**
*   When a FortiGate with multiple VDOMs joins the Fabric, each VDOM with connected devices appears as a separate entity in the Logical Topology view.
*   **Device Detection** must be enabled on the ports within a VDOM for it to discover downstream devices and be displayed in the Fabric topology.
*   All VDOMs of a single device must be part of the same Security Fabric.

**Device Identification:**
*   The process by which FortiGate identifies devices on the network to populate the topology views.
*   **Agentless (Passive):**
    *   Identifies devices based on traffic passing through the FortiGate.
    *   Requires direct Layer 2/3 connectivity.
    *   Uses methods like TCP fingerprinting, HTTP user agent, MAC address vendor codes, DHCP, and LLDP.
*   **Agent (Active):**
    *   Uses **FortiClient** installed on the endpoint.
    *   Provides richer information (e.g., logged-in user, OS details) and is location/infrastructure independent.
    *   Device is tracked by its unique FortiClient User ID (UID).
*   Device detection must be enabled on the relevant interfaces (`Network > Interfaces`).

### **Module 3: Extending the Security Fabric and Features**

**Extending the Security Fabric:**
*   The Fabric can be extended by integrating a wide range of products via **Fabric Connectors**.
*   **Examples:** FortiDeceptor (deception technology), FortiNAC (network access control), FortiPolicy (security orchestration), FortiWeb (web application firewall).
*   **External Connectors:** Allow integration with multi-cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP), SDN solutions (Cisco ACI, VMware NSX), and threat intelligence feeds.

**Automation Stitches:**
*   Automated workflows that consist of a **Trigger** and one or more **Actions**.
*   **Purpose:** To automate responses to security events across the Fabric.
*   **Trigger:** The event that initiates the stitch (e.g., "Compromised Host" detected, log message received, FortiAnalyzer IoC detected).
*   **Action:** The response(s) to be executed (e.g., quarantine endpoint via FortiClient EMS, run CLI script, send email/webhook notification, ban IP address).
*   Stitches can run actions sequentially or in parallel.
*   Configurable only on the root FortiGate.

**Security Rating:**
*   An auditing tool that provides an executive summary of the Fabric's security posture.
*   **Functionality:**
    *   Runs a series of checks against best practices and compliance standards.
    *   Generates a numerical score and a letter grade (A-F).
    *   Provides actionable recommendations to improve the score.
*   **Sections:** Security Posture, Fabric Coverage, Optimization.
*   Requires a FortiGuard Security Rating Service subscription for the full set of checks; a base set is available for free.
*   Results can be filtered to a specific Fabric device or viewed for all devices.

**Security Rating Notifications:**
*   Failed security rating checks can appear as contextual recommendations at the bottom of relevant pages in the GUI.
*   Clicking the notification takes you directly to the configuration page where the issue can be resolved.

**Topology Views:**
*   Graphical representations of the Security Fabric, available only on the root FortiGate.
*   **Physical Topology:**
    *   Displays devices as bubbles.
    *   Bubble size can represent traffic volume.
    *   Shows the physical interconnectivity between devices.
*   **Logical Topology:**
    *   Shows devices along with the logical interfaces (ports) used to connect them.
*   **Functionality:**
    *   Hover over devices for quick status details.
    *   Click on devices to access management tasks (login, authorize, quarantine).
    *   Provides at-a-glance visibility of the entire Fabric health and structure.

# Chapter 2: Firewall Policies and NAT

## 1. Chapter Summary

This chapter delves into the core functionality of FortiGate: controlling network traffic through firewall policies and managing network address translation (NAT). It begins by establishing that all traffic passing through a FortiGate must match a firewall policy, which dictates how the traffic is processed, including whether it's allowed or denied. The chapter emphasizes the top-down processing order of policies and the role of the implicit deny policy. It then introduces the various components that make up a firewall policy, such as interfaces, addresses, services, and schedules, and outlines the common policy types available, including standard firewall policies, virtual wire pair policies, and DoS policies. The configuration process is detailed, highlighting the mandatory policy name in the GUI (unless "Allow Unnamed Policies" is enabled) and the use of UUIDs for improved logging and management integration.

The chapter then thoroughly explains how FortiGate determines a policy match, focusing on criteria like incoming/outgoing interfaces, source/destination IP addresses, user identities, internet services, and protocol/port numbers. It clarifies the use of logical operators (AND/OR) for combining multiple objects within a policy's source and destination fields. Special attention is given to matching by source, including the use of IP addresses, FQDNs, geography, dynamic objects, and optional user/group identification. The concept of Geographic-Based Internet Service Database (ISDB) objects is introduced as a way to define and use location-based criteria in policies. Similarly, matching by destination involves address objects, ISDB objects, and geographic addresses. The crucial role of security profiles (like Antivirus, Web Filter, IPS) in inspecting traffic allowed by a policy is then discussed, alongside the importance of policy ordering and the impact of moving policies within the list. Best practices for policy creation, such as testing in maintenance windows and making policies as specific as possible, are also covered.

A significant portion of the chapter is dedicated to Network Address Translation (NAT). It explains the benefits of NAT, including hiding real addresses and conserving public IP addresses, and differentiates between Source NAT (SNAT) and Destination NAT (DNAT). SNAT configuration is detailed, covering the two main methods: using the outgoing interface address (common for many-to-one NAT, or PAT) and using dynamic IP Pools. The different types of IP Pools (Overload, One-to-One, Fixed Port Range, Port Block Allocation) are explained with their use cases, particularly how Overload and One-to-One IP Pools function. The chapter then shifts to DNAT, explaining its implementation through Virtual IPs (VIPs). VIPs map an external IP address (and optionally port) to an internal server's IP address (and port). The default Static NAT VIP behavior is contrasted with VIPs using Port Forwarding, which allows multiple internal services to be exposed via a single external IP on different ports. The chapter concludes by discussing the interaction of VIPs with policy matching and the importance of ARP reply settings for VIPs to ensure reachability.

## 2. Chapter Takeaways

### **Module 1: Firewall Policies**

**What Are Firewall Policies?:**
*   Define which traffic matches and how that traffic is processed (e.g., allowed, denied, inspected).
*   Processed top-to-bottom; the first matching policy is applied.
*   An implicit deny policy at the end drops any traffic not explicitly matched by a preceding policy.
*   FortiGate is a stateful firewall; only one policy matching the initiating traffic direction is usually needed.

**Components and Policy Types:**
*   **Objects used by policies:**
    *   Interface and Zone (logical grouping of interfaces).
    *   Address (IP, subnet, range, FQDN, geography, ISDB, MAC address range, dynamic).
    *   User and User Group.
    *   Internet Service objects.
    *   Service definitions (protocol and port).
    *   Schedules (time-based applicability).
    *   NAT rules (implicit in SNAT, explicit via VIPs for DNAT).
    *   Security Profiles (Antivirus, Web Filter, IPS, Application Control, etc.).
*   **Policy Types (Visibility depends on features enabled):**
    *   **Firewall Policy (IPv4, IPv6):** Standard policy for controlling traffic flow (focus of this chapter).
    *   Firewall Virtual Wire Pair Policy (IPv4, IPv6): For transparent mode or virtual wire pairs.
    *   Proxy Policy: For explicit proxy deployments.
    *   Multicast Policy (IPv4, IPv6): For controlling multicast traffic.
    *   Local-in Policy: Controls traffic destined *to* a FortiGate interface itself (e.g., admin access, VPN termination).
    *   DoS Policy (IPv4, IPv6): Protects against Denial of Service attacks.
    *   Traffic Shaping Policy.

**Configuring Firewall Policies:**
*   **Mandatory Policy Name (GUI):** By default, a unique name must be specified.
    *   Can be relaxed by enabling "Allow Unnamed Policies" in Feature Visibility. CLI does not mandate names.
*   **Flat GUI View:** Allows selecting objects by clicking and drag-and-drop.
*   **UUID (Universally Unique Identifier):** Automatically assigned to policies and objects for improved logging and integration with FortiManager/FortiAnalyzer.
*   **Internet Service as Source/Destination:** Can be used to easily define well-known internet services.

**How Are Policy Matches Determined?:**
*   **Matching Criteria:**
    *   **Incoming Interface(s):** Where the traffic enters the FortiGate.
    *   **Outgoing Interface(s):** Where the traffic will exit the FortiGate (determined by routing).
    *   **Source:** IP address(es), User(s)/Group(s), Internet Service(s), Geography.
    *   **Destination:** IP address(es), Virtual IP(s), Internet Service(s), Geography.
    *   **Schedule:** Specific times the policy is active.
    *   **Service:** IP protocol and port number(s).
*   **Action:**
    *   **ACCEPT:** Allows traffic, applies security profiles.
    *   **DENY:** Drops traffic.
*   Logical "AND" operation between different criteria fields (e.g., Source AND Destination AND Service).
*   Logical "OR" operation between multiple objects within the *same* field (e.g., Source_Address_1 OR Source_Address_2).
    *   "Show Logic" button in GUI clarifies "Any of" (OR) and "And any of" (AND between object types like address and user).

**Selecting Multiple Interfaces or Any Interface:**
*   By default, only a single incoming and single outgoing interface can be selected in the GUI.
*   "Multiple Interface Policies" option in Feature Visibility allows selecting multiple interfaces or the `any` interface.
*   Using `any` implies all interfaces; no other specific interfaces can be added alongside `any`.
*   CLI always allows multiple interfaces or `any`.

**Matching by Source:**
*   **Must specify at least one source address object.** Types include:
    *   IP address or range, Subnet (IP/netmask), FQDN (requires DNS resolution by FortiGate).
    *   Geography (country-based IP database, requires FortiCare).
    *   Dynamic (Fabric connector address, MAC address range).
    *   ISDB (Internet Service Database, requires FortiCare).
*   **May specify Source User/Group (optional):**
    *   Local firewall accounts, Remote server accounts (AD, LDAP, RADIUS), FSSO users, PKI-authenticated users.
*   ISDB and Geography objects are valid with an active FortiCare support contract for updates.

**Geographic-Based ISDB:**
*   Allows defining ISDB objects based on Country, Region, and City for granular location control.
*   Used in firewall policies for source/destination matching.
*   ISDB objects are referenced by name, not ID.

**Matching by Destination:**
*   Similar to source matching, uses:
    *   Address objects (IP, subnet, range, FQDN).
    *   ISDB objects.
    *   Geography.
*   **Virtual IPs (VIPs):** A key object type used as a destination for DNAT.
*   User identification is determined at the ingress interface; destination matching does not involve user objects.

**Security Profiles:**
*   Applied to `ACCEPT` policies to inspect traffic for threats.
*   Examples: Antivirus, Web Filter, IPS, Application Control, DNS Filter, File Filter.
*   Different security profiles may only be available in specific inspection modes (flow-based vs. proxy-based).
    *   Video Filter, VoIP, WAF, Virtual Patching, Inline-CASB typically require proxy-based mode or specific feature visibility enabling.

**Policy ID and Ordering:**
*   **Policy ID:** A unique numerical identifier automatically assigned when a policy is created in the GUI.
    *   Does not change when policies are reordered.
    *   The "Policy" column in GUI combines name and ID (if ID column is enabled).
*   **Policy Order:** Critical due to top-down processing. More specific policies should be placed above more general ones.
*   **Policy Views:**
    *   **Interface Pair View (Default):** Policies grouped by ingress/egress interface pairs.
    *   **By Sequence / Sequence Grouping View:** Policies listed in a single, comprehensive list in evaluation order. Allows easier understanding of overall policy logic.
*   **Moving Policies:** Can be done by drag-and-drop or "Move by ID" (in By Sequence/Sequence Grouping views).

**Combining Firewall Policies & Best Practices:**
*   Consolidate policies where possible by combining services or other objects, but carefully consider differences in security profiles and logging settings.
*   **Best Practices:**
    *   Test policies in a maintenance window.
    *   Be cautious when editing/disabling/deleting, as changes are immediate.
    *   Create specific policies; avoid overly broad `any`/`all` where possible.
    *   Use proper subnetting for address objects.
    *   Analyze and enable appropriate security profiles and logging on a per-policy basis.

**Inspection Modes on Firewall Policies:**
*   Determines how FortiGate inspects traffic for security profile processing. Set per firewall policy.
*   **Flow-based (Default):**
    *   Inspects packets as they flow through, without full buffering.
    *   Optimizes performance, lower resource usage.
    *   Supports fewer advanced security features.
*   **Proxy-based:**
    *   FortiGate acts as a proxy, buffering and reassembling traffic before inspection.
    *   More thorough inspection, supports more advanced features (e.g., CDR, some AV options, web profile overrides).
    *   Higher resource usage, potential for increased latency.
    *   Not available for all features on low-end FortiGates (typically < 2GB RAM).

**Logging Options:**
*   **Log Allowed Traffic:**
    *   **Security Events (Default):** Logs only when a security profile takes action (e.g., blocks a virus).
    *   **All Sessions:** Logs all traffic matching the policy, regardless of security profile actions. Useful for troubleshooting.
*   **Log Violation Traffic (for Deny policies):** Logs denied traffic.
*   **Generate Logs when Session Starts:** Creates a log at session initiation (in addition to session end). Increases log volume.
*   `ses-denied-traffic` CLI command: Optimizes logging for denied sessions by creating a session table entry.

**Monitor Traffic Logs:**
*   View logs in `Log & Report > Forward Traffic`.
*   Filter logs by Policy UUID, source/destination IP, etc., to find relevant entries.
*   Right-click a firewall policy and select "Show matching logs."

### **Module 2: NAT (Network Address Translation)**

**NAT Overview:**
*   Method of translating IP addresses (and optionally ports, then called PAT) in a packet.
*   **Benefits:**
    *   Hides real internal IP addresses from external networks (security).
    *   Prevents depletion of public IPv4 addresses (allows many internal devices to share one or few public IPs).
    *   Private address space flexibility (internal IPs can remain consistent even if ISP changes).
*   **Types:**
    *   **SNAT (Source NAT):** Translates source IP address and port. Typically for outbound traffic. Enabled on the firewall policy.
    *   **DNAT (Destination NAT):** Translates destination IP address and port. Typically for inbound traffic to internal servers. Requires VIP object(s) in the firewall policy destination.

**Firewall Policy SNAT:**
*   Configured under "Firewall / Network Options" in a firewall policy.
*   **Two main ways to perform SNAT:**
    *   **Use Outgoing Interface Address (Default):** Source IP is translated to the IP address of the policy's outgoing interface. This is many-to-one NAT (PAT).
    *   **Use Dynamic IP Pool:** Source IP is translated to an IP address from a pre-configured IP Pool.

**IP Pools:**
*   Define a single IP or a range of IPs to be used for SNAT.
*   Usually configured in the same range as an interface IP or a directly routable range.
*   **Types of IP Pools:**
    *   **Overload (Default):** Many-to-one or many-to-few NAT. Uses PAT to allow multiple internal hosts to share one or more public IPs. Similar to "Use Outgoing Interface Address" but with a specific pool.
    *   **One-to-One:** Each internal IP is mapped to a unique external IP from the pool on a first-come, first-served basis. No port translation.
    *   **Fixed Port Range:** (CGN feature) Preserves the original source port range.
    *   **Port Block Allocation (PBA):** (CGN feature) Assigns blocks of ports to internal users.

**Virtual IPs (VIPs) for DNAT:**
*   DNAT objects that map an external IP address and service port to an internal server's IP address and service port.
*   Used as the **Destination** object in an inbound firewall policy.
*   **Default VIP Type: Static NAT**
    *   One-to-one IP mapping.
    *   Applies to both ingress (DNAT) and egress (SNAT if NAT is enabled on policy and source matches VIP's mapped IP).
*   **Port Forwarding (Optional):**
    *   Allows redirecting traffic destined to a specific external IP and port to a *different* internal IP and/or port.
    *   Enables reusing a single external IP for multiple internal services by using different external ports.
    *   When port forwarding is enabled, the VIP no longer performs one-to-one IP mapping for SNAT automatically.
*   **VIPs can reference FQDNs:** Allows dynamic updates if the external/internal IP associated with an FQDN changes.
*   **`match-vip` CLI setting (on deny policies):** By default (`enable`), firewall address objects in a deny policy can also match traffic destined to VIPs. Disabling it makes the deny policy ignore VIPs, potentially allowing traffic to hit a subsequent allow policy for the VIP.
*   **ARP Reply for VIPs:** Enabled by default. FortiGate responds to ARP requests for the VIP's external IP address, making it reachable. Crucial if the VIP's external IP is on the same subnet as FortiGate's interface but not the interface IP itself.
